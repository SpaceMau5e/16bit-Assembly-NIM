# 16bit-Assembly-NIM
A 16bit Assembly Game of the Dr. NIM or The Game of NIM. 

Purpose: Resume

How to Play:

The game of NIM is simple, you start by selecting if you want to go first or second, then depending on which you pick either you will be asked to steal peices or the computer will. When its your turn you are asked to steal 1, 2, or 3 peices with the goal being to be the player who steal the last game peice on their turn. 

How it works:

The code behind it is simple, when the program is run it will asked the user if they wish to play first or second, they do so by move the cursor from player 1 to player 2 or vice versa, after which they hit enter the game will begin. It starts by rendering the game window and they depending on who goes first either has the computer run its first turn and steal some of the peices. They turns change hands and this process repeats until one side wins. 

The computer is programmed with some randomness for the few moves it needs to make that require randomness otherwise similar to my Python version it uses a mathmatical formula to decide the best move and then make it. 

Based on the mathmatical game NIM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#:~:text=Nim%20is%20a%20mathematical%20game,the%20same%20heap%20or%20pile.
